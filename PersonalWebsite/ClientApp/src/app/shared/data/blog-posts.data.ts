  'I want to chime in a bit. I was first exposed to porn at about 13, as you might guess, on the internet. It was a popup advert with a screen full of some 50 images of woman and/or men doing digusting things with each other. I\'m sure this event started a torrid pattern in my life, although I suppose not as depraved as for some other boys. I have always and continue to hold in revulsion, contempt and disgust the vast majority of the kinds of acts (and the circumstances in which they\'re portayed) which are popularly displayed in porn.\nWhat is called porn today (basically everything that isn\'t simple fertile Christian intercourse) is disgusting and never appealed to me. Naked woman posed ever titilatingly, salatiously, provocatively do continue to appeal to me.\nWhat drives me up the wall some times is the guys are looking at porn today, looking at strange men having sex with woman they desire. This in itself confuses me. Why watch another man, do you not see how disgusting it is to watch another man having sex with a woman you desire? This is cuckoldry.\nSecondly the kinds of acts, 99% (I guess, I haven\'t seriously surveyed the porn landscape for atleast a decade) are unnatural, the king of acts which two horrificaly judged and burnt cities are now named after. I still don\'t understand how anyone could ever find these disgusting kinds of acts appealing, with anyone, by anyone, much less oneself.\nThirdly, why does porn focus so much on the man and woman bits? Every other part of the woman is more appealing than her nether parts. I\'ve stared at them long and intently (before I became Catholic), they\'re not very pretty. Beautiful is not one of woman nor man\'s bits attributes. I\'m quite sure the situation is the same from the woman\'s perspective. Almost every other part of a woman\'s exterior real estate can be said to be beautiful, even a work of art in itself (though mostly scandalous and damnable for unmarried men to ponder in any great detail, just to be clear).\nI speculate that he natural inclination is to be slightly repulsed by man and woman bits, so as to direct the eyes of spouses to those of the other spouse rather than anywhere else. So why are men (and perhaps even you) looking at porn which zooms the camera in on these bits? And why do we have hair which hides this region if not to prevent us from wanting to look there? (And please spare me the jibber jabber from biology books)\nFourth thing that to me that seems to be wrong with porn: The personality of the person presented as a supposed mate. No qualities suitable for motherhood are showing, whatever. Almost none. The natural result (that is, a child) of the act if it were to come is given 0 attention. The result of the natural inclination to reproduce (ie. a child) is given no regard whatever.\nI feel a peculiar (for the most part not lustful) magnetic attraction to women who do well with children, are joyful, simple and having still much of their innocence and their newly awoken and fitting instincts for motherhood. No women in porn present themselves as particularly good prospects as mothers of children. Think about it, none of them point to motherhood. Some of them are depicted as being mothers, but none of those as having suitable qualities for motherhood.\nI hear so often bloggers say: "Porn is too much, it overloads the man\'s senses", I think much more that the case is that porn is a violation that men consent to in increasing degrees, at some conscious level consenting to further levels of depravity... cuckoldry... sodomy... motherlessness... morbidity and eventually eternal damnation. How can the end of it all be anything but damnation if a man falls further into shame deeper and deeper into that which he knows is more and more depraved. If he should die in it he will never be willing to ask for help, because of the shame, the guilt, the sickness and the despair. We already have enough trouble facing up to mere humans with these kinds of staints on our conscience, much less the divine (and virginal) majesty, should we suffer to plunge ourselves into ever greater shame, dishonour and disgrace.\nWe must repent. We must find again disgust for disorder and depravity, we must not entertain the idea that what passes for porn displays anything that is really like sex as the divine majesty intended it. Porn should be reviled in almost every way as depravity, sewage from the deep dark brown underbelly of hell into which mankinid is currently plunging itself face first, with full consent of the will.\nIf you\'re one of the fortunate few who haven\'t the foggiest idea what I\'m talking about, God bless you and may he keep your mind\'s eye clear of the things which I\'ve tried to hint at distantly and hopefully not scandalously. For the rest of us aspiring gentlemen... God help us all. Holy Mary Mother of God and ever virgin, pray for us.'
