# Space Program

## Description

I'm not sure what this is yet but I'll be sure to write it down here once I do.

I originally had the thought of simulating a ship ascending from a planet into orbit accelerating only horizonally by thrusting at an angle which keeps vertical velocity to 0.
However, now I've made many small decisions which lead to more and more realism implementations which require yet more realism implementations.

Classes have been implemented for starsystems, stars, planets and ship. As yet there is no way to interact with them. The classes in this project are supposed to be almost entirely stand-alone for eventual future use with an Angular frontend project.
